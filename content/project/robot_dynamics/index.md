* Exercise 1: position of the front-right foot given any joint angles.
* Exercise 2: linear and angular velocity of the front-right foot given any joint angles and joint velocities.
* Exercise 3: mass matrix of the system given the generalized coordinates using Composite Rigid Body Algorithm (CRBA).
* Exercise 4: nonlinearity of the system given the generalized coordinates and generalized velocities using the Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm (RNEA).
* Exercise 5: generalized acceleration for the given generalized coordinate, velocity, and force using Articulated Body Algorithm (ABA).
